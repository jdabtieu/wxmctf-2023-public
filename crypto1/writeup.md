Going through the cards, it seems like each card probably corresponds to one letter in the flag.

The brand/bank is all the same, so we can ignore it. Going through the other properties, if we
get all the first letters of the countries, we get `HSAC_LAER_YLLATOTFTC`, which when reversed
is `CTFTOTALLY_REAL_CASH`.

This exercise is designed to show that [security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) does not work.

Flag: `CTF{TOTALLY_REAL_CASH}`
