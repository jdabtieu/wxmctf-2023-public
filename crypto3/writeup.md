## Analysis of problem
Reading the script, we see that it creates a random generator of the permutation group containing $100,000$ elements, and performs the diffie hellman key exchange with them.

## Permutation groups and cycles
An very useful property of the permutation group generated by G is that it contains subcycles. These sub cycles are created by a set of elements mapping to the next in a small cycle. 
For example, where 1 maps to 2, and 2 maps to 1, where these two elements form a subcycle of 1. We can find these cycles, and determine the power of the public parameters **A** and **B** mod each of the lengths of these cycles, by finding its index within the cycle. 
We can then use the chinese remainder theorem to recover the private exponent, and calculate the shared secret.

## A note on Pohlig Hellman
After implementing the above solution I noticed that what I was doing wasn't even Pohlig Hellman, just another way of solving the exponent mod factors of the order. Props to those of you who did implement it that way though.
