# Sneaky Spying

Shhh, don't tell the MGCI kids, but I spied on one of their conversations! Uhh, I couldn't really understand what they were saying though. Can you let me you what they said? -For educational purposes of course.

Oh, they also had this open on their phones. I don't know what to make of it though: <https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html>
