The audio file contains some random sounds, we can open it in Audacity to look closesly at what it actually is.

These seem like waves oscillating at different frequencies, corresponding to different notes. Using the Frequency
Analysis tool (select a range, then Analyze --> Plot Spectrum), we find that the first note is `D`.

Repeating for the other notes, we get `DECAFE`.
