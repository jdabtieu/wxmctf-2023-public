# 2048

After the sudden wave of the popularity of chess, in WLMAC and MGCI, there was a new wave of popularity for 2048. Some student tried to make some version of 2048 with QR codes or something, I disagree that they are similar, but I guess both require you to continuously choose one of two moves to try to get to an optimal goal, and any wrong move can lead you to a dead end. Anyways, they think I can't win it because I'm complaining about it too much... maybe I can't so I guess thats why I am here bribing you with some points to help me win it. (thanks)
