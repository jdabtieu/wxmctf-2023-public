Each QR code leads to a new PDF. To solve this challenge, you can create a script
that gets & parses QR codes from each PDF and then continues traversing the pages
using an algorithm such as BFS or DFS. At the last later, there will be one QR
code leading to a pastebin containing the flag. There are 4 others that lead to
various other unrelated places.
