# WxMFashionClubs
As newly established fashion clubs in spawn in WLMAC and MGCI, another rivalry is formed.
WLMAC's club believes they are much better than MGCI's who think the opposite. In order to
decide who is the better club, WLMAC's fashion club challenges MGCI's fashion club to find
the K-pop music video filmed in front of a grocery store and a Canada Post and for the
members at the one-tenths (A) and four-fifths (B) way of the MV, find the designer product
ID of the shirts they are wearing in their landscape (as in width is greater than height)
photocards from the album released around 5 and a half months after that album. The flag
format is `wxmctf{designeridA_designeridB}`.

Hint: both IDs start with `A`. If you think you found the flag, but isn't submitting,
create a ticket in our Discord server.
