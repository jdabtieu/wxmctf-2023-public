This challenge is an OSINT challenge testing your ability to Google. From the problem statement, it can be broken up into 5 parts as seen below.

**1. K-pop music video filmed in front of a grocery store and a Canada Post**

By googling `kpop music video canada post` or something similar, you will see that it's [_LIKEY_ by Twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2hlQkVJZhE&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment).

**2. members at one-tenths (A) and four-fifths (B) way of the MV**

By calculating with math, at 0:22 you will see Sana, at 2:57 you will see Dahyun (the scene jumps to Dahyun just at 2:57).

Alternatively, on the YouTube video page, you can hit `1` to go to 10% of the video duration, and then `8` to go to 80%.

**3. album released around 5 and a half months after that album**

As _LIKEY_ is from the album _Twicetagram_ (October 30, 2017), the album released 5 and a half months after is _What is Love?_ (April 9, 2018).

**4. landscape (as in width is greater than height) photocards**

After googling, the intended landscape photocards are the `what is love monograph photocards` however some people found the group one which worked too (smh). A tip to help find the photocards is to search `twice what is love photocard template` to see a picture of all photocards.

**5. designer product ID of the shirts** 

There are multiple different ways of doing this but searching "pink versace shirt" & "pink moschino betty boop shirt" and manually looking with a combination of image search works but also using sites (eg. k-style files) that already finds you the specific clothes they are wearing for certain media are a faster way. From those, find sites with product ID's.

For Sana's: From [this article](https://hypebae.com/2018/4/versace-vintage-logo-t-shirt-pink-blue), you can find the [official link](https://www.versace.com/us/en-us/women/clothing/t-shirts-sweatshirts/womens-vintage-logo-t-shirt-a2242/A79760-A201952_A2242.html?cgid=120300#wt_mc=US.SEM.Google.Text&utm_campaignname=03_DSA_Women_Apparel_US&utm_adgroup=T-shirts&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5YDE7oS42gIVjQOGCh2KqgaMEAAYAiAAEgJMsvD_BwE&start=1) of the product (which has now been taken down).

For Dahyun's: I could only find resellers, so [this link](https://www.ikrix.com/ca/betty-boop-print-cotton-tshirt-moschino-84210) was what was used.

From there, you could get the flag.

Honestly, I wanted people to find the Instagram post of the duo wearing the same outfits but I felt nice and also because I already contaminated peoples search histories and YouTube recommendations (sorry not sorry).
