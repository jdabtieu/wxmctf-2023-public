# BURIED SEEDCRETS

Several MGCI students are trying to find a WLMAC dead drop. However, the only clue they have for its location are five words:
- arch
- emptied
- splice
- bulletin
- board

The flag for this question is CTF{md5([sunrise time] x [sunset time] x [tree height (m)] x [sunrise azimuth] x [sunset azimuth])}

Sunrise and sunset time are numbers in hhmm format, in 24 hour time. For example, 6:15pm would be 1815.

All values are rounded to integers and measured from the base of the most prominent tree on March 3rd. 

Alternatively, send us a video of you touching grass beside the tree on Discord. https://discord.gg/5mzA2EFuHC

The flag for this challenge starts with CTF and not wxmctf.
