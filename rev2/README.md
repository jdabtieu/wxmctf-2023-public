# Natural Selection

The great tech giant, err, I mean scientist Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection in the 18th (19th?) century.
Since MGCI students are so much better than WLMAC students, surely WLMAC will extinct themselves - I mean cease to exist eventually as natural selection takes over. Now, which operating system was Darwin again?
