# Row, Row, Row Your Boat

> Gently down the stream<br>
> Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily<br>
> Life is but a dream

Sam hummed, as he rowed his way from MGCI to WLMAC to beat up some kids on the CCC. Unfortunately, the stream was pushing back very hard, and he wasn't able to make it all the way. As a result, he had to row back to MGCI, but by that time he only had 15 minutes left on the CCC, and scored 6/75. Can you do better?
