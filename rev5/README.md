# x130

64-bit programs and modern x86 CPUs are way too complicated.

If 64-bit is x64 and 32-bit is x86, then 8-bit is x130!

My new x130 architecture is so novel that I'm sure the WLMAC losers can't reverse engineer it.

Hint: the custom architecture is based on/inspired by <https://github.com/jdabtieu/yan85-disassembler> including the optional `.MEMORY` directive, with some key differences
