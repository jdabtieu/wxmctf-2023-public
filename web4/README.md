# Brawl: Shopping Spree

Now that Leyang has leveled up his favourite character, Darryl, he wishes to buy a new skin for his character to flex on the peasants at MGCI. Unfortunately, "Cupcake Darryl" is prohibitively expensive and Leyang is secretly in great debt (someone laundered the school funds before he could). Help Leyang get some $$$ so he can buy his favourite skin!

By a stroke of luck, Leyang was able to gather certain pieces of information, listed as follows: 
- In addition to the skins table, there seems to be a secretskins table
- All columns of the secretskins table appears to be present in the skins table
- The site seems to employ primitive filtering
- Gold coins and star points have been discontinued, and gems are now the only accepted currency
- All Brawl Stars players at MGCI are bad
